          <h3>The Brief</h3>
          <p>
            Fizantakraal Trout Lodge wanted to modernise their website and create an online presence that reflected the high standards and luxurious yet natural feel of the lodge itself. The site needed to reflect the experience of Fizantakraal and show potential guests what the Fizantakraal experience is about.

          <h3>Redesign and Creating Identity</h3>
          <p>
            The design of the site reflects the style of the lodge and its surrounds, and is built to harmonise with the images of Fizantakraal to recreate the experience of Fizantakraal online. We built the site to be fully responsive for desktops, small screens, tablets and mobile phones.

          <h3>Content and Story-telling</h3>
          <p>
            We provided copywriting, and worked with Dan at Fizantakraal to decide what information guests needed, and developed an information heirarchy that enabled guests to both get an overall feel for the lodge, and also easily find specific content.

      <!--<h3>A Responsive Design Case Study</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="col-md-8"> 
          Fizantakraal Private Trout Lodge wanted a site that showcased the natural beauty of the lodge and would convert better to bookings. The design of the website mirrored the wilderness surroundings, and it was developed to be fully responsive across all devices. We also provided content copywriting.
